# Penicillin-Synthesis
This is my Supervised Learning capstone project for the Thinkful Data Science Bootcamp.
The data on penicillin synthesis was gathered from kaggle.com, all information about it's source is inside of the notebook.
I used Tableau to generate some of the plots and graphs.
This project was written inside of google colab.
